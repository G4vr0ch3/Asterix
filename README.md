This project will be in active development from the 22nd of August 2022 until at least the 10th of November 2022.  
The ultimate goal is to propose an Open-Source USB malware cleaner kiosk that is portable and offers good functionalities.

This is my graduation project from the French Naval Academy, in collaboration with the Informatic Institute of the University of Amsterdam.

You will find here the pieces of software that make Asterix as well as the report concerning the project one redacted.  
You will also find functionnalities that have not been implemented but were part of the thinking/designing process.
